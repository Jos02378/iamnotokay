        story: `Hi to anyone who's reading this (probably no one will). My name is anonymo (I would prefer if my identity were to be hidden) and I've been dealing with a lot of shit lately, but I don't know how to react. I found this website through word of mouth and I figured why not give it a go. First off, I'd like to point out that I'm not on any medications and I don't have any mental illnesses. All I know is that even though I've been dealing with a lot of shit (losing loved ones, failing my exams, getting my heart broken by an opposing gender) I feel nothing. I don't have any strong feelings to these incidents and I think it is due to constant dissapointment from one thing leading to the other. I remember being a young kid always asking questions, being content with any and every answer given to me. God I miss those days. Now, as an adult, I have a part-time job and I'm struggling to pay rent. I live my life everyday as if it's a chore. The last time I had time for myself was when I went to the park to look at the children playing in the sandbox. And looking back as I'm writing this, I can't remember the last time I was happy. To the kids reading this, please know that you're going to grow up one day and I sincerely hope that you find something you love and enjoy. Cheers.`,

        story: `Content: It is difficult for me to write this article, so please be kind with your words.
            My brother Calvin was born a bit slow and had a slight deformity (he had more fingers in his left and had more toes on his right). When he was young, his legs needed a brace to learn to walk. He is mentally retarded,, and the other children would bully him becacuse of it.
            But when we were young, we didn’t know much about these things, and it’s just that when he was a child, it was a little weird to talk about. Additionally, He likes to eat powdered milk. For example, and he thinks it’s better than ice cream. (To be honest with you, it is actually good).
            He went to a NHL game once. Fell in love with hockey and he wanted to play hockey for a living.
            But eventually, his eyesight got worse. He was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, which makes his eyesight deteriorate over time. At first, he wore ordinary glasses. Then, he stopped wearing contact lenses and went completely blind. His dream of playing hockey would be ruined, but he continued. Eventually, he found love and married someone named Elsa.
            Calvin sometimes calls me to chat. Usually, I am very busy and depressed. Sometimes he would chat for a minute and then I vigorously told him that "I must go." But he never gave up on me. He's always been on the phone.
            One night, he wasn’t feeling well, and he called me. I’d been thinking about my behaviour. And I was ashamed of myself for not making time for my brother. I picked up the phone, and we talked about life. But I didn't apologize. I told him that I'd come and see him once the whole thing clears up. But I never got the chance to do it again. That was the last time I ever got the chance to call him, and I didn't even say I love you.
            The next day his wife called from the hospital. She was very upset.
            Calvin died of septic shock that morning. We only learned about it later.
            Please cherish your loved ones. They'll mean much more to you once they're gone.`,

        story: `My grandmother looked heartbroken and embarrassed when she tried to put a piece of cake in my grandfather's mouth. He groaned and spat it out. It was hard to see a man I had always thought was funny, lively, and strong, reduced to the fragile, shaky, whining thing strapped to the wheelchair in front of me.
            He died the next day, and that's not the saddest thing that has ever happened to me, but I will never forget my grandmother repeating, "Usually it's not that bad”. It’s as if she were apologizing that I went out my way to see them and that she thinks it’ll break my heart when I see my own grandfather not being the same man that he was. I miss you grandpa`,

        story: `I came home after attending 7 hours of class, working 8 hours, and doing 4 hours of homework for that night. I was exhausted, hungry, and only had a couple of dollars in my bank account to use for gas and parking
            Earlier that day, I heard a teacher say that I was lazy and didn’t deserve to be in a decent classroom while sipping her expensive name brand coffee.. Even the very wealthy parents forgot to pay me, even though I had already reminded them that they owed money for tutor classes that month.
            I went through the front door and found my pet dogs barking and crying. They were also hungry because their dinner plate was empty for most of the day. I searched the fridge and cupboards for something else to give them and something to eat. There was only one can of wet dog food and some rice. I had contemplated putting them on adoption but I don’t want to lose them. My life's a mess

        story: `Depression can be lots of things but here’s my honest and personal take on it.
            It feels like emptiness. you've got these prospects and none of them appear interesting. you may do some art, or play some music, however that simply doesn't feel right. There' no joy in it. you may copulate along with your important other, but you can't muster the desire. you may play video games, or browse a book. however what' the point? There' no real profit to any or all of it but passing the time. you may stand up and build lunch. however no, you're not that hungry, and if you close your eyes, time can pass a touch faster. you'll lie there. That works. It doesn't need active effort to try and do one thing sleeveless. Everything is as empty and fruitless as lying and staring out your window to look the shifting grass and the sky, so why even do anything?

        story: `I decided to use an extension cord to hang myself from the garage rafters. I decided to run a quick test to make sure the beam stays the same before saying goodbye to my family. During the test, I slipped out of the chair and hanged myself. During the few minutes that I was hanging, the panic I felt was only to convince myself that I should live. Before I go, I desperately need to tell my mother that I love her. My father too. I can only think of getting rid of the rope so I can say a well-deserved goodbye and let them know how much I love them. When I was lucky enough to step back in the chair, I realized that I was not ready yet. There is too much love left in my heart. I think it gave me a second chance to realize that I don't want to experience it. I'm fine now. I have two beautiful girls and a man who will give me the moon. I'm glad that it didn’t work, because I'm sure if I sent my last goodbye text message, I wouldn't realize how I really felt.
